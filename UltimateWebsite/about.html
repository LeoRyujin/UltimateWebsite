        <p>We are a group of students working on a web development project. We are students of the University of Tabuk and we study at the University of Tabuk in the College of Computers. Our goal is to design websites and program in the best possible way, and this website and this wonderful website was designed with the help of my friends, and as you can see, as our first project, it looks very good, and I want to thank my friends in the project.  For their help to me, and I would like to thank Dr. Omar Ibrahim Al-Asiri for urging us to design websites in the best possible way and making it easy to provide information in the lecture.</p>
